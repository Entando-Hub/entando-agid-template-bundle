## Overview
The AGID Template implements the [Municipality design kit](https://italia.github.io/design-comuni-prototipi/esempi/bootstrap-italia/template-homepage.html) by [Agenzia per l'Italia digitale (AGID)](https://www.agid.gov.it/it/design-servizi/linee-guida-design-servizi-digitali-pa).
The information architecture included in the Municipalities design kit is a starting point to create a complete UX solution and to manage contents and elements.
The template page templates, based on the [Designers Italia UI](https://designers.italia.it/modello/comuni/) Kit and the [Bootstrap Italia library](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/), serve to speed up the creation of the front-end of the site and are useful as examples of pages and contents.

**Warning:** The AGID Template is meant to be the starting point for a new site. During installation you will receive a warning that a number of stock or out-of-the-box components will be overridden. If you choose to skip one or more of these components during the installation process (using the Install Plan options in the App Builder) there may be visual and/or functional side effects.
