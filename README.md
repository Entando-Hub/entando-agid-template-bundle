## _AGID Solution Template_

The Agid solution template implements the  [Municipality design kit] by Agid.
The information architecture included in the Municipalities design kit is a starting point to create a complete UX solution and to manage contents and elements.
The template page templates, based on the [Designers Italia UI] Kit and the [Bootstrap Italia library], serve to speed up the creation of the front-end of the site and are useful as examples of pages and contents.

## Installation:
