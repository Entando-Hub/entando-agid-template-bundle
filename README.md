## Overview
The AGID Template implements the [Municipality design kit](https://italia.github.io/design-comuni-prototipi/esempi/bootstrap-italia/template-homepage.html) by [Agenzia per l'Italia digitale (AGID)](https://www.agid.gov.it/it/design-servizi/linee-guida-design-servizi-digitali-pa).
The information architecture included in the Municipalities design kit is a starting point to create a complete UX solution and to manage contents and elements.
The template page templates, based on the [Designers Italia UI](https://designers.italia.it/modello/comuni/) Kit and the [Bootstrap Italia library](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/), serve to speed up the creation of the front-end of the site and are useful as examples of pages and contents.
