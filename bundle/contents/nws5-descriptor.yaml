JHipster has been included in Entando since the 6.0 release, helping customers generate microservices and micro frontends. The ability to customize JHipster via a Blueprint has given us the flexibility to automate key elements of the Entando platform and to enhance the developer experience.</p>\n<p>With our sponsorship we’re looking forward to getting more deeply involved in the JHipster community and to contribute to JHipster 7 and beyond.</p>\n<p>Technical Notes</p>\n<p>JHipster and the blueprint pattern give Entando developers the ability to quickly create a standardized Spring Boot microservice which can be installed into an Entando cluster on Kubernetes.  </p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"
